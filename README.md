# COmparative_Study_of_Multimodal_Represenations
---
The comparative study of multimodal representations:
  1. Early fusion
  2. Late fusion   (as baseline models)

  3. CLIP Model
  4. ViLBERT Model  (as transformer models)

  5. Multi-Variate Auto Encoder (MVAE)

The following datasets are used for this thesis:
  1. Amazon Review Dataset --> Text only modality 
  2. FashionAI dataset  --> Text and Image Modalities
  3. Movielens --> Text and Graph Modalities
  4. Visual Genome --> Text, Image and Graph Modalities
